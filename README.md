## MCP Connection

Connected to NeonPanel's MCP server at `https://mcp.neonpanel.com/mcp` (OAuth2).
Provides 66 tools across: brand analytics, financials, forecasting, supply chain,
inventory, COGS, advertising, imports, Shopify, and account management.

## Install

In Claude Code, install directly from this repository:

```shell
/plugin marketplace add neonpanel/claude-plugin
```

Then connect your NeonPanel account when Claude prompts for OAuth on first tool use.
Skills activate automatically when your query matches their specialty.

After installing, ask Claude:

```text
Help me set up NeonPanel.
```

Claude will guide you through account readiness, Amazon/Shopify integrations,
and the two MCP connectors:

- NeonPanel MCP (`https://mcp.neonpanel.com/mcp`) for commerce operations data.
- NeonaSphera MCP (`https://admin.neonasphera.com/mcp`) for Shared Workspace,
  memory, and file-memory workflows.

## How It Works

Each skill encodes the role definition, domain knowledge, routing logic, and tool
playbooks from a trained NeonPanel agent. When you ask a question, Claude matches
it to the most relevant skill and uses that agent's expertise + NeonPanel MCP tools
to answer with live data.

Skills carry reference documents (playbooks, module maps, canonical claims) that
provide detailed domain knowledge and step-by-step workflows.
